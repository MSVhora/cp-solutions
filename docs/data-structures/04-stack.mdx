## What is a Stack?

A **stack** is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.

### LIFO( Last In First Out )

This strategy states that the element that is inserted last will come out first. You can take a pile of plates kept on top of each other as a real-life example. The plate which we put last is on the top and since we remove the plate that is at the top, we can say that the plate that was put last comes out first.

```kt
import java.util.ArrayDeque

fun main(args: Array<String>)
{
    // Initialize Stack
    val stack =  ArrayDeque<Int>();

    // Push operation
    stack.addFirst(1)
    stack.addFirst(2)
    stack.addFirst(3)
    stack.addFirst(4)

    // Pop operation
    val poppedElement = stack.removeFirst() // throws exception if stack empty
    val poppedElement = stack.removeFirstOrNull() // Wont throw exception if empty

    // Peek operation
    val topElement = stack.first()
    val topElement = stack.firstOrNull()

    // Size
    stack.size

    // Check empty
    stack.isEmpty()
}
