## What is a Queue?

A **Queue** is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

### FIFO( First In First Out )

- A Queue is like a line waiting to purchase tickets, where the first person in line is the first person served. (i.e. First come first serve).
- Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called the front of the queue(sometimes, head of the queue), similarly, the position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added, is called the rear (or the tail) of the queue. See the below figure.

fun main(args: Array<String>)
{
    // Initialize Queue
    val queue =  ArrayDeque<Int>();

    // Enqueue operation
    queue.addLast(1)
    queue.addLast(2)
    queue.addLast(3)
    queue.addLast(4)

    // Dequeue operation
    val removedElement = queue.removeFirst() // throws exception if queue empty
    val removedElement = queue.removeFirstOrNull() // Wont throw exception if empty

    // Peek operation
    val frontElement = queue.first()
    val frontElement = queue.firstOrNull()

    // Size
    queue.size

    // Check empty
    queue.isEmpty()
